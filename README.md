# Python_Programming_Project

What is the goal of the project?

The main goal of the project is to create a learning app (Flash card) with all the skills learned from the Udemy bootcamp videos and in the class, together with the exchange of knowledge among the students. The app is to help users learn German words and daily sentences, a translation from English to German.

What is the roadmap to reach that goal?
We decided to start with:
1. function of the app such as in learning German words.
2. come out with some sets of basic codes.
3. add in graphic user interface (GUI).
4. improve the codes for a better user experience.
 
What did you try / did not work / can be improved upon?
We used Colab for the main code developemnt and sharing, it works for the basic codes.
However, when we needed to add in the GUI, Colab was not able to run the code as we need to organize the code or modified it.
We needed to use VScode or created virtual environment with all the installed dependencies to run the GUI code.
